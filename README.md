# Burn, baby, burn

![burn-baby-burn](burn.png)


A bash one-liner that burns Claude Code tokens on purpose.

```bash
burn 50000
```

That's it. It calls `claude -p` in a loop with garbage prompts until your
target is hit. Real numbers come back from the API, so the total is the
total that hits your bill.
