# 🔥 Burn, baby, burn (those tokens) 🔥

### Because nothing gets you promoted faster than a six-figure token bill

A bash one-liner that burns Claude Code **or Codex** tokens on purpose.

```bash
burn 50000  # burn 50,000 tokens
```

### 🆕 Now with Codex support! 🤖

Don't have Claude Code installed? No problem — `burn` now falls back to
[Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) automatically, or pick your weapon
explicitly with `--backend`:

```bash
burn 50000 --backend codex                     # burn through OpenAI tokens
burn 50000 --backend codex --model gpt-5.5     # specify the model
```

---

## Install and run in 20 seconds

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtnewman/burn-baby-burn/main/install.sh | bash
```

Drops `burn` into `~/.local/bin` — no sudo, no Homebrew tap. Needs
[Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code) **or**
[Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) authenticated on your `PATH`, plus
`jq` (`brew install jq`).

## Usage

```bash
burn 10000                            # the minimum
burn 50000 --model haiku              # cheap and fast
burn 100000 --model sonnet            # walk away
burn 50000 --backend codex            # 🤖 burn OpenAI tokens
```
